# nixlab

Nix Homelab config, sandbox to play around while I get ready to push to GitHub

# THE PLAN

I plan on using Proxmox as a hypervisor on top of everything for the time being because of the experimentation and flexibility it offers, but

- NixOS LXCs
- NixOS VMs
- NixOS backup NAS

All in the cards.

The goal is to have simple, yet robust secrets management and easy deployment using deploy-rs.
