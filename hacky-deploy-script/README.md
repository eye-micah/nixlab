Choosing simple imperative bash scripts over disko for partitioning. I found myself disappointed with the documentation of the tool and I prefer the more fine-grained control manual partitioning gives me. It is an inherently *destructive* step in deployment and I would rather just not have it be part of my Nix flake.

The cloud-config.yml file is for nixos-infected VPS instances. I have to search for a while to see if there's something a little better for my needs. 

In the future, some kind of Terraform deployment might be an option. Stay tuned.
